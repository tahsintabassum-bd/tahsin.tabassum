                        This study examines transportation equity in Oklahoma County, a key region within the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area. 
                        It highlights how the uneven distribution of transportation resources disproportionately impacts marginalized communities, 
                        creating barriers to essential services. Using the Transportation Justice Threshold Index Framework (TJTIF), 
                        the study analyzes demographic, socio-economic, and transportation variables such as race, income, age, public transit access, 
                        and crash rates through a composite index to identify areas of transportation injustice. 
                        Municipalities with positive index values are classified as Transportation Justice (TJ) areas, requiring intervention. 
                        The findings reveal that Woodlawn Park, Arcadia, and Valley Brook face significant transportation challenges, 
                        while Nichols Hills and Lake Aluma are at risk of becoming TJ areas. These areas struggle with limited public transit, 
                        traffic safety issues, economic development challenges, and vehicle availability. 
                        The study recommends improving public transit coverage, expanding service hours, and integrating multimodal solutions. 
                        It emphasizes equitable Transit-Oriented Development (eTOD) and community-based planning to enhance accessibility 
                        while mitigating displacement risks. 
                        The study aims to guide policymakers and urban planners in addressing transportation inequities, 
                        advocating for policies that prioritize expanded transit services and sustainable funding models. 
                        Future research should focus on the long-term impacts of these interventions, incorporating technology in transit systems 
                        and actively engaging communities in planning processes to create a more just and efficient transportation system in Oklahoma.

                        Accessibility is a multifaceted concept essential for evaluating the spatial relationship between origins and destinations, 
                        encompassing factors like distance and speed (Nicholls, 2001). In recent decades, accessibility, 
                        particularly concerning the quality and distribution of urban parks, has become integral to urban green space development. 
                        Scholars discuss that when the distribution of parks aligns with the population density, 
                        accessibility to urban parks is enhanced (Tsou et al., 2005). Optimizing accessibility is pivotal for determining park locations, 
                        ensuring ease of access for the maximum number of people. Parks are deemed suitable and convenient when they adequately 
                        serve densely populated areas. It is imperative for urban green spaces to be sizable enough to accommodate the local population 
                        and be easily reachable within walking distance, as emphasized in previous studies (La Rosa, 2014; Wright Wendel et al., 2012).

                        Dallas, a rapidly expanding city in Texas, has experienced significant population growth, with the metropolitan area witnessing 
                        a 25% increase in population from 2010 to 2022 
                        (See: <a href="https://texas.reaproject.org/" target="_blank">https://texas.reaproject.org/</a>). 
                        As urban sprawl continues unabated, 
                        concerns about sustainability have heightened, particularly regarding the preservation of urban green spaces amidst rapid 
                        development. The rapid urbanization trend poses challenges for city planners and decision-makers, necessitating sustainable 
                        strategies to guide new projects while safeguarding the city's green spaces from various threats. Despite numerous studies on 
                        urban growth, research specifically addressing urban green spaces remains scarce. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To address this gap, this study aims to assess the distribution and accessibility of urban parks in Dallas, 
                        TX through conducting socio-spatial analysis. We conducted comprehensive mapping of Dallas's 195 parks across various categories, 
                        including pocket/mini parks, civic plaza parks, linear parks, neighborhood parks, community parks, special purpose parks, 
                        metropolitan parks, and dog parks. To achieve this, we employed diverse data sources and mapping tools, 
                        including Google Earth Pro, City of Dallas GIS Services, land use data, and Census Bureau Data. 
                        Initially, our analysis focused on examining the geographical distribution of urban parks within the city. 
                        Subsequently, we utilized the network analyst tool in ArcGIS Pro to delineate the service regions of these parks. 
                        The study further employs the Lorenz curves strategy to delve into the equity scenario regarding park accessibility in Dallas. 
                        This method allows for a detailed analysis of the distribution of park resources across different segments of the population 
                        (Delbosc & Currie, 2011), providing valuable insights into potential disparities and informing equitable planning strategies.

                        The study reveals that urban parks in Dallas are predominantly concentrated in the city center, 
                        with special-use parks catering to both locals and visitors. However, this clustering leads to an uneven distribution of parks, 
                        posing accessibility challenges for many citizens. Specifically, there is an evident scarcity of neighborhoods and pocket parks 
                        in the southern part of the city, impacting a significant portion of the population. This shortage underscores the need for a 
                        more equitable distribution of parks throughout Dallas to effectively serve all residents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By employing the Lorenz curve method, the study will further analyze the equity scenario regarding park accessibility in Dallas, 
                        shedding light on potential disparities. These findings are crucial for improving the accessibility and spatial sufficiency of 
                        parks in the city. City planners can utilize this information to better understand the current adequacy of parks and identify 
                        locations for future urban park development. Ultimately, the study's insights can inform more equitable and effective urban park 
                        planning and design strategies in various geographical location in the United States.
