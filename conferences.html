                        Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) has encompassed a broad research area in the domain of affective computing since the change of emotional states in response to variations in brain activities. In this paper, a novel emotion recognition approach is proposed employing the wavelet decomposition and node reconstruction of EEG signals. Following the wavelet decomposition of the EEG signal into five different levels, a node reconstruction scheme is employed to reconstruct the signal at each level to retain the original signal length. Subsequently, a 2D matrix is formed by combining the reconstructed signal information at all decomposition levels. In view of incorporating the information of multi-channel EEG signal, a 3D frame is formed combining the 2D matrices acquired from all available channels. The frame is applied as an input to a 2D deep neural network where the signal information at different decomposition levels is passed to the depth dimension of the neural network. The proposed method offers substantial performance in the classification process for the valence and arousal domain considering the performance of all subjects. The average accuracies obtained for valence and arousal domains in binary class problems are 93.06% and 91.93% respectively.

                        Since the variations in brain activity provide a pathway for different emotional states, emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) has embraced a vast research area in the realm of human-computer interaction. This paper proposes a novel deep neural architecture based on bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) for automated emotion classification. In the proposed scheme, the long-short-term memory (LSTM) blocks effectively capture important information throughout time steps. The deep-stacked bidirectional mechanism attributes essential features in the forward and backward directions for time-series data. Finally, the acquired feature vector is applied to the dense classifier to categorize different emotion classes. In contrast to the conventional method, an additional feature extraction step is eliminated, resulting in a substantially reduced computational complexity. In this work, extensive and detailed experiments are conducted on a widely available dataset, and satisfactory results are obtained for the valence and arousal domains, considering the performance of all subjects. In binary classification performance, the average accuracy for the valence domain is 82.36%, and the average for the arousal domain is 83.10%.

                        Arrhythmia classification using an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal has obtained a wide range of attention as arrhythmia is a potentially fatal heart disease that necessitates immediate medical attention. Automated arrhythmia identification and categorization utilizing computational techniques can fasten the proper treatment. In this paper, a novel deep ensemble model is proposed where both time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics of ECG signals are explored for the purpose of automatic arrhythmia classification. Moreover, an efficient feature called Time Multiplexed Fast Fourier Transform (TMFFT) is extracted that provides useful information for categorization in the frequency domain. In addition, an end-to-end deep neural architecture namely LACRNN (Lead-wise Attention with CNN and RNN) is also proposed to classify arrhythmia from the raw ECG signal while the extracted TMFFT feature is applied to a simple 2D CNN. Very satisfactory performances are obtained for each class of arrhythmia where the experimentation is carried out on a publicly available dataset namely the China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset. The average F1 score obtained in the 9-class problem is 90%.

                        Emotion analysis by electroencephalogram (EEG) provides vital information about our overall well-being. Analyzing the change in emotional states in response to changes in brain activity has the potential to anticipate the synchronization of attentional, cognitive, and behavioral reactions to emotionally expressive events and hence detect severe mental disorders. This paper proposes an efficient deep learning architecture, DEEPSATTNET, to classify emotions. In contrast to the traditional method, an additional stage for feature extraction is skipped to reduce computational costs. The CNN block of the DEEPSATTNET network captures spatial characteristics from raw EEG data, whereas the LSTM block efficiently encodes significant features over time steps. To acquire the intra-relationship of the extracted feature, the proposed method employs an efficient self-attention mechanism that effectively assigns greater weights to the most relevant information. Finally, the collected feature vector is fed into the dense classifier, which classifies distinct types of emotions. To validate the performance of the proposed architecture, thorough and extensive experimentations are carried out on a publicly available EEG emotion (DEAP) dataset considering mixed subject analysis. For binary class problems, the mean accuracies found for valence and arousal dimensions are 88.65% and 89.24%, respectively.
