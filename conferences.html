                        Accessibility is a multifaceted concept essential for evaluating the spatial relationship between origins and destinations, encompassing factors like distance and speed (Nicholls, 2001). In recent decades, accessibility, parkcularly concerning the quality and distribukon of urban parks, has become integral to urban green space development. Scholars discuss that when the distribukon of parks aligns with the populakon density, accessibility to urban parks is enhanced (Tsou et al., 2005). Opkmizing accessibility is pivotal for determining park locakons, ensuring ease of access for the maximum number of people. Parks are deemed suitable and convenient when they adequately serve densely populated areas. It is imperakve for urban green spaces to be sizable enough to accommodate the local populakon and be easily reachable within walking distance, as emphasized in previous studies (La Rosa, 2014; Wright Wendel et al., 2012).

                        Dallas, a rapidly expanding city in Texas, has experienced significant populakon growth, with the metropolitan area witnessing a 25% increase in populakon from 2010 to 2022 (See: hnps://texas.reaproject.org/). As urban sprawl conknues unabated, concerns about sustainability have heightened, parkcularly regarding the preservakon of urban green spaces amidst rapid development. The rapid urbanizakon trend poses challenges for city planners and decision-makers, necessitakng sustainable strategies to guide new projects while safeguarding the city's green spaces from various threats. Despite numerous studies on urban growth, research specifically addressing urban green spaces remains scarce.

                        To address this gap, this study aims to assess the distribukon and accessibility of urban parks in Dallas, TX through conduckng socio-spakal analysis. We conducted comprehensive mapping of Dallas's 195 parks across various categories, including pocket/mini parks, civic plaza parks, linear parks, neighborhood parks, community parks, special purpose parks, metropolitan parks, and dog parks. To achieve this, we employed diverse data sources and mapping tools, including Google Earth Pro, City of Dallas GIS Services, land use data, and Census Bureau Data. Inikally, our analysis focused on examining the geographical distribukon of urban parks within the city.

                    <p>
                        Subsequently, we uklized the network analyst tool in ArcGIS Pro to delineate the service regions of these parks. The study further employs the Lorenz curves strategy to delve into the equity scenario regarding park accessibility in Dallas. This method allows for a detailed analysis of the distribukon of park resources across different segments of the populakon (Delbosc & Currie, 2011), providing valuable insights into potenkal disparikes and informing equitable planning strategies.

                    <p>
                        The study reveals that urban parks in Dallas are predominantly concentrated in the city center, with special-use parks catering to both locals and visitors. However, this clustering leads to an uneven distribukon of parks, posing accessibility challenges for many cikzens. Specifically, there is an evident scarcity of neighborhoods and pocket parks in the southern part of the city, impackng a significant porkon of the populakon. This shortage underscores the need for a more equitable distribukon of parks throughout Dallas to effeckvely serve all residents.

                    <p>
                        By employing the Lorenz curve method, the study will further analyze the equity scenario regarding park accessibility in Dallas, shedding light on potenkal disparikes. These findings are crucial for improving the accessibility and spakal sufficiency of parks in the city. City planners can uklize this informakon to bener understand the current adequacy of parks and idenkfy locakons for future urban park development. Ulkmately, the study's insights can inform more equitable and effeckve urban park planning and design strategies in various geographical locakon in the United States.
