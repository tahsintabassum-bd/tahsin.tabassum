                        This study examines transportation equity in Oklahoma County, a key region within the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area. 
                        It highlights how the uneven distribution of transportation resources disproportionately impacts marginalized communities, 
                        creating barriers to essential services. Using the Transportation Justice Threshold Index Framework (TJTIF), 
                        the study analyzes demographic, socio-economic, and transportation variables such as race, income, age, public transit access, 
                        and crash rates through a composite index to identify areas of transportation injustice. 
                        Municipalities with positive index values are classified as Transportation Justice (TJ) areas, requiring intervention. 
                        The findings reveal that Woodlawn Park, Arcadia, and Valley Brook face significant transportation challenges, 
                        while Nichols Hills and Lake Aluma are at risk of becoming TJ areas. These areas struggle with limited public transit, 
                        traffic safety issues, economic development challenges, and vehicle availability. 
                        The study recommends improving public transit coverage, expanding service hours, and integrating multimodal solutions. 
                        It emphasizes equitable Transit-Oriented Development (eTOD) and community-based planning to enhance accessibility 
                        while mitigating displacement risks. 
                        The study aims to guide policymakers and urban planners in addressing transportation inequities, 
                        advocating for policies that prioritize expanded transit services and sustainable funding models. 
                        Future research should focus on the long-term impacts of these interventions, incorporating technology in transit systems 
                        and actively engaging communities in planning processes to create a more just and efficient transportation system in Oklahoma.

                        Accessibility is a multifaceted concept essential for evaluating the spatial relationship between origins and destinations, 
                        encompassing factors like distance and speed (Nicholls, 2001). In recent decades, accessibility, 
                        particularly concerning the quality and distribution of urban parks, has become integral to urban green space development. 
                        Scholars discuss that when the distribution of parks aligns with the population density, 
                        accessibility to urban parks is enhanced (Tsou et al., 2005). Optimizing accessibility is pivotal for determining park locations, 
                        ensuring ease of access for the maximum number of people. Parks are deemed suitable and convenient when they adequately 
                        serve densely populated areas. It is imperative for urban green spaces to be sizable enough to accommodate the local population 
                        and be easily reachable within walking distance, as emphasized in previous studies (La Rosa, 2014; Wright Wendel et al., 2012).

                        Dallas, a rapidly expanding city in Texas, has experienced significant population growth, with the metropolitan area witnessing 
                        a 25% increase in population from 2010 to 2022 
                        (See: <a href="https://texas.reaproject.org/" target="_blank">https://texas.reaproject.org/</a>). 
                        As urban sprawl continues unabated, 
                        concerns about sustainability have heightened, particularly regarding the preservation of urban green spaces amidst rapid 
                        development. The rapid urbanization trend poses challenges for city planners and decision-makers, necessitating sustainable 
                        strategies to guide new projects while safeguarding the city's green spaces from various threats. Despite numerous studies on 
                        urban growth, research specifically addressing urban green spaces remains scarce. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To address this gap, this study aims to assess the distribution and accessibility of urban parks in Dallas, 
                        TX through conducting socio-spatial analysis. We conducted comprehensive mapping of Dallas's 195 parks across various categories, 
                        including pocket/mini parks, civic plaza parks, linear parks, neighborhood parks, community parks, special purpose parks, 
                        metropolitan parks, and dog parks. To achieve this, we employed diverse data sources and mapping tools, 
                        including Google Earth Pro, City of Dallas GIS Services, land use data, and Census Bureau Data. 
                        Initially, our analysis focused on examining the geographical distribution of urban parks within the city. 
                        Subsequently, we utilized the network analyst tool in ArcGIS Pro to delineate the service regions of these parks. 
                        The study further employs the Lorenz curves strategy to delve into the equity scenario regarding park accessibility in Dallas. 
                        This method allows for a detailed analysis of the distribution of park resources across different segments of the population 
                        (Delbosc & Currie, 2011), providing valuable insights into potential disparities and informing equitable planning strategies.

                        The study reveals that urban parks in Dallas are predominantly concentrated in the city center, 
                        with special-use parks catering to both locals and visitors. However, this clustering leads to an uneven distribution of parks, 
                        posing accessibility challenges for many citizens. Specifically, there is an evident scarcity of neighborhoods and pocket parks 
                        in the southern part of the city, impacting a significant portion of the population. This shortage underscores the need for a 
                        more equitable distribution of parks throughout Dallas to effectively serve all residents.

                    <p>
                        By employing the Lorenz curve method, the study will further analyze the equity scenario regarding park accessibility in Dallas, 
                        shedding light on potential disparities. These findings are crucial for improving the accessibility and spatial sufficiency of 
                        parks in the city. City planners can utilize this information to better understand the current adequacy of parks and identify 
                        locations for future urban park development. Ultimately, the study's insights can inform more equitable and effective urban park 
                        planning and design strategies in various geographical location in the United States.

                        At present, people worldwide are facing the negative impacts of climate change. On top of that, 
                        Bangladesh is one of the most climate vulnerable countries. Many climate migrants from rural vulnerable 
                        areas now choosing to seek refuge in slums of cities in Bangladesh. The study has identified the WASH 
                        condition of the selected slums in Rajshahi district through WASH poverty index, a multidimensional, WASH-focused, 
                        thematic indicator that is also a powerful tool for planning, targeting and prioritizing WASH challenges. 
                        Through integrated analysis of WASH and poverty linkages, the index assists to identify key issues which can 
                        guiding policymakers towards appropriate action. The index itself is an agglomeration of 3 different indices and 
                        few more subindices comprising them. Among those, water poverty index (WPI) accounts for availability, accessibility, 
                        water points, use of water and relevant environment. The second indicator, sanitation poverty index (SPI), considers 
                        access, capacity, and use. Lastly, hygiene poverty index (HPI) deals with water safety plan, food hygiene, personal 
                        hygiene, and domestic hygiene. Weightage of the sub-indices have been determined by literature review and experts’ 
                        opinion. The indices and WASH poverty index is measured using the method of multivariative summation and arithmetic 
                        mean respectively. While the SPI and HPI both are lowest in the slum named Ashrayan, WPI is the lowest in 
                        Char Christan Para. Almost half of the slum dwellers of Char Christan don’t have access to pure water. 
                        Interestingly, 67% respondents from all slums using shared toilets, and more than half respondents considered the 
                        toilets unhygienic, SPI of all slums are close to zero. Based on the study, people are most likely to maintain hygiene, 
                        but to do so is difficult due to economic crisis and lack of service provision. Overall, though Ashrayan has the lowest 
                        WASH poverty index, each slum is lagging behind mainly in maintaining a standard level of sanitation facilities and hygiene.
