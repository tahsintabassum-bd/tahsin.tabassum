                    In this project, I explored transportation inequities across 20 municipalities in Oklahoma County. Using demographic, socio-economic, and transportation/land use variables, this study highlights areas requiring urgent interventions to ensure equitable access to transportation systems. Key variables include race, age, disability rates, household income, single-parent households, vehicle availability, cost of living, public transit access, crash rates, and truck volumes. Data was sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau, Oklahoma Highway Safety Office, and Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The Transportation Justice Threshold Index Framework (TJTIF) was applied to calculate a composite index for each municipality. This process involved calculating the Average Regional Threshold (ART), assigning scores using a relative graduated scale, and summing the variable scores into a single composite index for analysis. Advanced geospatial analysis tools were employed using RStudio. The study identified Arcadia, Valley Brook, and Woodlawn Park as Transportation Justice (TJ) areas with positive composite index values, indicating significant transportation inequities. Additionally, Nichols Hills and Lake Aluma were flagged as potential TJ areas, highlighting the need for preventive measures to avoid further transportation disparities.

                    The study highlights critical challenges, including high crash rates in Oklahoma City and Arcadia and limited public transit access in suburban areas. Income inequality remains prevalent in Spencer and Forest Park, while single-parent households are notably concentrated in Arcadia, Valley Brook, and Smith Village. Additionally, regions like Spencer and Arcadia exhibit low vehicle ownership, underscoring the need for improved public transit accessibility. To address these issues, the project recommends expanding public transit coverage in high-priority areas such as Arcadia and Valley Brook, enhancing multimodal integration to connect transit with cycling and pedestrian networks, and promoting equitable Transit-Oriented Development (eTOD) to support inclusive and sustainable urban growth in Oklahoma.

                    In this project, I aim to identify transit supply-demand disparities at the block group level in Oklahoma City. The study area, encompassing 725 block groups across six counties, integrates data from various sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Oklahoma City Open Data Portal, OpenStreetMap and General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Data.

                    The methodology involves three primary steps: identifying transit-dependent populations, assessing transit supply, and calculating the transit gap.To determine transit-dependent populations, the study uses formulas developed by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Factors include population age, vehicle availability, group quarter population, and carpooling rates. Transit-dependent population density for each block group is calculated by dividing the total transit-dependent population by the block group area, with the values standardized using z-scores to represent transit demand. For transit supply, the study applies seven metrics adapted from Jiao (2017), including the number of transit stops, transit routes, frequency of service, sidewalk length, bike route length, low-speed roads (under 40 mph), and intersection density. These metrics capture both physical infrastructure and service availability. Spatial data were joined to block group shapefiles in ArcGIS Pro to analyze and map transit supply, with z-scores calculated for standardization. The overall transit supply for each block group is derived by aggregating the z-scores of all metrics. The last step involves calculating the transit gap by subtracting the transit demand z-score from the transit supply z-score for each block group.

                    Block groups with a significant negative transit gap are identified as transit deserts. The analysis reveals that 85% of block groups have insufficient transit supply, with transit deserts located in suburban and peripheral areas. The study recommends targeted transit investments in underserved areas, multi-modal integration to improve transit and active transportation connections, and community engagement to ensure equitable planning.

                    For spatial accessibility analysis, the study employed the Network Analysis Approach to calculate realistic service areas for different park types based on actual travel distances. Community parks were assessed using driving distances of 1 km, 2 km, and 5 km, revealing that while most of the city had access, the southern areas experienced significant gaps. For neighborhood parks, walking distances of 0.5 km, 0.8 km, and 1 km were analyzed, showing widespread insufficiency across the city and highlighting the limited accessibility of parks within walking proximity. Mini/pocket parks were evaluated at shorter walking distances of 0.25 km and 0.5 km, which revealed that these parks are highly concentrated in central Dallas while peripheral areas remain underserved.

                    In this project, a macroscopic analysis is conducted to identify risk factors influencing crash severity for non-motorists, such as pedestrians and cyclists, using crash data from 2015–2021 provided by the Oklahoma Highway Safety Office. The methodology integrates advanced data preprocessing, statistical model, machine learning models, and clustering to analyze relationships between crash severity and environmental, behavioral, and infrastructure-related variables.

                <p class="authors">
                    The data preprocessing refined the dataset by removing features with excessive missing values or low variance and simplifying categorical variables. Missing values were imputed (median for numerical, mode for categorical), and one-hot encoding was applied for machine learning compatibility. Numerical features were standardized with z-score normalization, and outliers were capped based on z-scores. To address class imbalance, SMOTE generated synthetic samples for underrepresented crash severity classes, enhancing predictive performance.

                    Dimensionality reduction and clustering involved PCA to reduce the dataset to two principal components, capturing most of the variance and simplifying clustering. Using the Elbow Method, K-Means clustering identified five optimal clusters based on feature similarity. For enhanced visualization, t-SNE was applied, providing clear insights into distinct groupings and patterns within the data. Multinomial Logistic Regression model, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost were optimized using hyperparameter tuning and 5-fold cross-validation to enhance performance and reduce overfitting. A stacking ensemble method was implemented, combining predictions from these models into a meta-model, which improved multi-class classification accuracy by leveraging the strengths of individual models.

                    The analysis identified five crash clusters: daytime crashes with minor injuries (Clusters 1 and 4), urban intersection crashes with dense traffic risks (Cluster 2), nighttime crashes under poor lighting leading to severe outcomes (Cluster 3), and hit-and-run crashes with varied severity (Cluster 5). The Random Forest model, the best-performing individual model, identified key predictors such as environmental factors such as weather, lighting, pedestrian behavior, type of road and intersection in influencing crash outcomes, offering valuable data to policymakers for targeted interventions in high-risk conditions like poor lighting, adverse weather, and risky pedestrian actions.

                    The project focuses on creating a zoning framework for Taft, Oklahoma, a historically significant all-Black town facing challenges like economic decline, limited infrastructure, and population loss. Through site visits, community engagement, and asset mapping, the team identified key community needs and aspirations. Residents emphasized the lack of basic amenities such as grocery stores, gas stations, and schools, along with a need for youth-oriented recreational spaces, economic revitalization, and cultural preservation. Feedback revealed the importance of supporting small businesses, fostering self-reliance, and preserving Taft’s rich history, including its cowboy culture and local festivals. Based on these insights, the project proposes zoning recommendations such as mixed-use zones integrating residential, commercial, and public spaces, special districts for historic preservation, and zones prioritizing infrastructure upgrades, recreational areas, and agricultural development. These efforts aim to balance Taft’s cultural preservation with sustainable growth, fostering a self-sufficient community. In the next phase, the team will finalize the zoning framework to align with Taft’s unique identity and aspirations.

                    This study examines the distribution and equity in accessibility of healthcare facilities in Dhaka city, focusing on the jurisdictions of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC). Using secondary data, the research applies the Location Quotient (LQ) method and the Kernel Density model in ArcGIS to analyze the concentration and distribution patterns of healthcare facilities, with data further represented through pivot tables and charts in Microsoft Excel and ArcGIS. The findings reveal significant disparities, as healthcare facilities are concentrated in specific wards like ward 1, 19, 27, and 32 of DNCC, and ward 35, 37, 50, and 51 of DSCC, while many others, such as ward 34, 43, and 44 of DNCC and wards 6, 7, and 34 of DSCC, lack even basic public and private healthcare infrastructure. The study further identifies an inverse relationship between the ratio of public and private facilities and the proportion of low- and high-income populations, with underserved areas often being poorly connected to wards with better facilities. These findings underscore the critical need for targeted urban planning and policy interventions to address healthcare accessibility gaps, contributing to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and improving equitable access to healthcare services across Dhaka.

                    This study investigates significant changes in travel behavior among Dhaka residents during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on an online survey of 448 respondents. The analysis highlights notable shifts in trip purposes, mode preferences, and travel frequency, shaped by socio-economic factors and risk perceptions. During the first wave, medical trips were prioritized, while work trips became more dominant in the second wave. Shopping trips saw the largest decline, with many replaced by online alternatives. A sharp drop in bus usage was observed as it was perceived as the riskiest mode of transport, with shifts toward private cars and rickshaws. However, bus usage slightly increased during the second wave as safety perceptions improved. Captive riders, those without access to private vehicles, continued using buses despite high risk perceptions due to economic constraints, while choice riders, with access to private transport, exhibited greater risk aversion. Safety perceptions improved significantly from the first to the second wave, leading to increased trip frequencies for work and shopping. Travelers prioritized less crowded vehicles and adherence to social distancing when selecting modes of transport.Policy recommendations include promoting mass vaccination, enforcing social distancing on public transport, investing in sustainable systems like MRT and BRT, and ensuring equitable access to low-risk transport modes. These measures address the pandemic's impact on travel behavior and enhance transport safety in Dhaka.

                    The study examines how the pandemic affected travel patterns and transportation safety in Bangladesh's rural areas. Based on a survey of 157 households across 157 villages, it reveals significant declines in work and education-related trips due to closures, while trips for buying and selling remained stable. Overall travel frequency decreased, with women traveling less than men. A shift in mode choice was observed, with reduced bus usage and increased reliance on smaller vehicles like CNGs and autos, while water transport usage showed mixed trends. Transportation costs rose significantly, becoming unaffordable for many, and travel times increased due to reduced vehicle availability. Villages under government-declared lockdowns were more likely to adopt safety measures such as mask mandates, social distancing, and vehicle sanitization, though compliance was inconsistent. The study emphasizes the need for tailored transportation policies in rural areas to improve affordability, accessibility, and safety, while addressing challenges exacerbated by the pandemic.

                    This study examines the role of local government in managing the COVID-19 pandemic within Ward-21 of Dhaka North City Corporation. Using Participatory Rapid Appraisal (PRA) tools such as timelines, Venn diagrams, problem prioritization, and SWOT analysis, the research highlights the challenges, processes, and potential improvements in pandemic management. Key activities included food and financial aid distribution, public awareness campaigns, sanitization of public spaces, roadside basin construction, and mass vaccination drives, led by the ward councilor and the Disaster Management Committee. Despite these efforts, challenges such as limited testing and treatment facilities, inefficiencies in relief distribution, lack of social distancing adherence, and weak coordination with NGOs and hospitals were evident. Strengths included effective leadership, periodic relief distribution, and vaccination efforts, while opportunities like expanding social protection programs and increasing local fundraising contrasted with threats from insufficient medical resources and inconsistent relief management. The study recommends forming a dedicated disaster management committee, improving documentation of relief activities, enhancing NGO coordination, and enforcing stricter social distancing measures. These findings emphasize the need for strategic local governance to mitigate the pandemic's impact and improve community resilience.

                    This study investigates utility and safety facilities in large-scale kutcha bazars in Dhaka city, essential marketplaces for daily necessities like agricultural goods, poultry, and fish. Recognizing their significance, particularly in urban areas, the research evaluates the level of service from the perspectives of both buyers and sellers. Six major kutcha bazars in Dhaka were selected as study sites. Data were collected through questionnaire surveys of buyers and sellers, complemented by key informant interviews with market management representatives. Findings reveal that the current condition of facilities in these markets is unsatisfactory. This research addresses a previously unexplored topic and aims to encourage further studies to improve conditions in kutcha bazars.
