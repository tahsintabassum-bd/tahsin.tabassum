                    <h2>Signal Overshadowing Attack by Manipulating LTE Broadcast Signals Using SDR Platforms</a></h2>
                </div>
                <p class="authors">
                    This project explores the vulnerabilities in LTE broadcast messages and demonstrates a signal overshadowing attack, which exploits the absence of integrity protection in LTE broadcast signals. Using this approach, malicious signals are injected over the air without deploying a fake base station (FBS), leveraging the capture effect to ensure the stronger signal is decoded by victim devices. This attack modifies critical LTE broadcast messages, such as Master Information Block (MIB) and System Information Blocks (SIBs), enabling scenarios like denial-of-service and network downgrading.

                <p class="authors">
                    Implemented on the srsRAN 4G platform, the attack utilizes synchronized USRPs for precise timing and frequency alignment, ensuring high stealth and success rates. The project highlights the need for stronger defenses, such as digital signatures for LTE broadcast messages, to counter such stealthy attacks. Ethical considerations and compliance with local regulations are crucial while experimenting with this project to avoid interference with operational networks.

                    <h2>Automatic Emotion Recognition from EEG Signal in Time-Frequency Domain with Reduced Channels Using Deep Neural Architecture</a></h2>
                </div>
                <p class="authors">In this project, an automatic emotion recognition scheme is adopted utilizing a multi-channel EEG signal that can discriminate between different classes of emotions and select some significant channels that are mostly responsible for the elicitation of emotions. The main theme of the proposed method is to classify emotions with deep neural architectures with the raw EEG data or the extracted features from it. The baseline of the EEG signal is excluded from the recorded data in the pre-processing stage to obtain the raw EEG signal relevant to emotion elicitation in response to the audio-visual stimuli. The baseline excluded raw EEG signal is divided into multiple segments to increase the number of EEG trials and combining all the channel information of an EEG trial, the obtained 2D matrix is applied to the proposed deep neural architecture. The proposed network with its channel attention mechanism offers satisfactory classification performance. As the spectral information provides salient information regarding different emotional states, the EEG trial signals are decomposed into several sub-bands and 3D frames are formed combining the temporal and spectral information of the available channels. The frame contains significant information that eventually provides superior classification performance. In addition, EEG signals are also analyzed in the time-frequency domain, where the multi-level discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients or the extracted feature from the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) domain is considered. For a given channel of EEG data, each CWT coefficient from different scales is mapped into a corresponding strength-to-entropy component ratio (SECR) plane to obtain a 2D feature matrix, namely CEF2D. In order to reduce the computational complexity, effective channels and CWT scale selection schemes are proposed based on the energy-to-entropy ratio in the CWT domain. Extensive experimentation is carried out on a publicly available emotion (DEAP) dataset and very satisfactory classification performance is obtained for valence and arousal types of emotions both in 3-class and 2-class scenarios.</p>
